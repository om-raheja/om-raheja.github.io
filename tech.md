# Technology

My opinions and usage of technology are rigid after several years of change. Before entering high school, I switched my main device to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) which was the main factor in forming my opinions.

As of now, I restrict myself to solely using a laptop running [void linux](https://voidlinux.org) and use jailed, outdated iOS on my phone in order to make it as "dumb" as possible. 

My git is currently hosted on [disroot](https://disroot.org) which can be viewed [here](https://git.disroot.org/omr).

Hardware implementation of nand2tetris hack cpu coming soon...

### Purchase considerations
I haven't saved up enough for these yet, but I am considering:
- a Thinkpad x230 for use with libreboot
- [this vps](https://cloudserver.net/billing/index.php?rp=/store/custom-packages/leb-1gb-annual-plan)
- a nice domain from [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com)
- maybe the latest Google Pixel so I can use [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org) for 7 years, as outlined on their [updated EOL policy](https://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/)

I don't want to waste a lot of money on expensive gadgets. After all, [engineered failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) is a thing!

Apart from that, here are a few cool links to look at:

[Anonymous Planet](https://anonymousplanet.org) basically explains why our world is the way it is
[LowEndBox](https://lowendbox.com) has the cheapest VPSes I've seen
[Tilde.club](https://tilde.club) has an awesome community surrounding a free shared host
[OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org) is the most secure OS in the world, gaining support from daily use
[Plan9](https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/plan9.pdf) is an interesting research paper outlining an efficient operating system, which was succeeded by [9front](https://9front.org)
[CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) an awesome public domain license employed in all my software
[Invidious](https://yewtu.be) is a nice YouTube proxy if you care about your privacy
[Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org) offers free books sourced from Z-Library and other sources
