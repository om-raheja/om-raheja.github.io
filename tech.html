<h1 id="technology">Technology</h1>
<p>My opinions and usage of technology are rigid after several years of change. Before entering high school, I switched my main device to <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> which was the main factor in forming my opinions.</p>
<p>As of now, I restrict myself to solely using a laptop running <a href="https://voidlinux.org">void linux</a> and use jailed, outdated iOS on my phone in order to make it as &#8220;dumb&#8221; as possible. </p>
<p>My git is currently hosted on <a href="https://disroot.org">disroot</a> which can be viewed <a href="https://git.disroot.org/omr">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="purchase-considerations">Purchase considerations</h3>
<p>I haven&#8217;t saved up enough for these yet, but I am considering:<br/>
- a Thinkpad x230 for use with libreboot<br/>
- <a href="https://cloudserver.net/billing/index.php?rp=/store/custom-packages/leb-1gb-annual-plan">this vps</a><br/>
- a nice domain from <a href="https://namecheap.com">NameCheap</a><br/>
- maybe the latest Google Pixel so I can use <a href="https://grapheneos.org">GrapheneOS</a> for 7 years, as outlined on their <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/">updated EOL policy</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to waste a lot of money on expensive gadgets. After all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">engineered failure</a> is a thing!</p>
