# Documents

I don't want to rely on an external file hosting service for public files such as the nightmares Google Drive and OneDrive. So, I have my only public file listed here. 

**Unlike the content of this website, these documents may be subject to copyright. If you would like to distribute my work, please send me an [email](mailto:rahejaom@outlook.com)**

[Petition to Enact Privacy Laws](use/petition.pdf) is a draft of my petition which is undergoing legal proceedings. If you wish to sign, you need to be a NJ resident and send me an [email](mailto:rahejaom@outlook.com). 

[Sample Curriculum](use/SampleCurriculum.pdf) is an Arduino project based sample curriculum that I am using in my teaching business. [blog post](blog/new-curriculum.html).

[Enter Code Mode Ad](use/EnterCodeMode.jpeg) is an advertisement for my startup of teaching programming and circuitry. The email listed no longer works, it currently only remains to demonstrate my GIMP skills.
