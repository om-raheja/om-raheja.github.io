## Special Thanks

This website is hosted due to the following services:

[OpenBSD Amsterdam](https://obsda.ms) provides OpenBSD vmm(4) servers, and donates a portion of their earnings to [OpenBSD Foundation](https://www.openbsdfoundation.org/), the nonprofit supporting OpenBSD based in Canada. 

[Free DNS](https://freedns.afraid.org) is an awesome service that gives people free subdomains which I found on [getfreedomain.name](https://getfreedomain.name)

[ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com) because [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is not reliable with [Free DNS](https://freedns.afraid.org) for SSL. Being a commercial provider with a limited free plan, it has met my needs.

[BashBlog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) is now my favorite bash script. It runs the blog.

[Markdown.pl](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) made by John Gruber, used in conjunction with BashBlog. Love it, makes my life so much easier.
