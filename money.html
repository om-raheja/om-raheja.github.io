<ul>
<li>Teaching programming and circuitry. I do have <a href="https://eyelevel.com">teaching experience</a> and have taught programming before, sometimes to people my own age. I have a wide range of experience but only a few clients. If you are interested, please send me an <a href="mailto:rahejaom@outlook.com">email</a></li>
<li>Some sort of silicon valley startup. Business and technology being my major interests, I can&#8217;t help but be interested in <a href="https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1410&amp;context=jitim">Quantum Computing</a> as the alternative to the Von Neumann architecture.</li>
<li>Kitchen automation, because my mom is always working in the kitchen when she is done with work :(</li>

<h3 id="financial-journey">Financial Journey</h3>
<p>I started investing when my 5th grade teacher put my class in a stock market competition the year before he retired, in an attempt to teach us math. Not only did he teach us math, he taught us about the fallacies involved in speculation which were reiterated and furthered once I read <em>The Intelligent Investor</em> by Benjamin Graham. Since then, it has been my outlined philosophy to invest in stocks only which have a sound underlying business and are available at bargain levels.</p>
