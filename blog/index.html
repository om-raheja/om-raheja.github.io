<p>It's been a while since I last wrote a blog post and I never thought I would come to see this page again. </p>

<p>Since then, my old site <a href="https://omraheja.us.to">omraheja.us.to</a> went out of service and the SSL certificates stopped working. After finding NameCheap's edu offer for a website, I am back on <a href="https://omraheja.me">omraheja.me</a>!</p>

<p>It's been longer than 8 months since I've last written anything here. In that time, I started doing whatever interested me and I really learned to embrace failure. After doing <a href="https://leangap.org">LeanGap</a> this summer, I acquired a taste for entrepreneurship. </p>

<p>I've also somewhat lost my interest in finance. Money is interesting, but the financial sector has no impact on the real world. I don't think I'll ever get back to reading <a href="https://sec.gov">SEC</a> pages on companies, but I've started <a href="https://aquarc.org">aquarc</a> in the past few months and I might have to learn about all the technical details in there anyway.</p>

<p>To expand on my work at aquarc, I decided to make an <strong>all-in-one</strong> platform for high schoolers. Actually, it wasn't my idea. I was working on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/aviquo/">aviquo</a> but the team wasn't really moving at the pace I wanted it to. That's not to say that the people there aren't smart, just that I needed room to fully expend my random and spontaneous bursts of energy whenever I get them. It's kind of like a car; the entire vehicle moves due to spontaneous explosions happening in the engine. Just that I needed a few more of those to fully get started.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges I'm facing at aquarc is keeping the team culture strong and problem-solving oriented. I have to work with about 10 people which isn't a problem in any way, but I'm going to be out for almost the entire winter break and I can't be there to fix every inconvenience. Most of the people on aquarc's tech team only understand frontend; that forces me to fill in for features like the log-in feature with email verification codes (using raw smtp, of course) or the blog post backend for aquarc. Neither of these are complicated, just that they don't understand the backend enough and don't want to poke around because it seems difficult. But a lot of tasks going forward are going to get more difficult.</p>

<p>To counteract this problem, I want to have my team solve a USACO problem together every week. Seems a little bit odd for a web development team but if I can get them thinking then I've done my job. Let's see what happens.</p>

<p>The problems should lead to better problem solving which should mitigate the second problem, the inability to fit time into their schedules. Our team is composed almost entirely of high schoolers and undergrads and with exams around almost every corner, finding time is difficult. But I'm hoping if I can help them think a little bit they can learn to make ends meet. Not to say they can't "think", just that they need to broaden their perspective MORE. I had the same problem last year with my petition, when I refused to use proprietary services to spread the word. Smart in theory because it is about privacy rights, but in practice it won't work. </p>

<p>That's also partially why I came back to this blog. This entire site is a reflection of my inner minimalism and desire to have the lightest online footprint possible. I've started pruning my old unnecessary accounts from my experimentation phase like Figma, Locofy, or Liberapay. None of those are necessary for my startup now and I understand what I need to keep things moving smoothly.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my tutoring initiative started to take off. <a href="https://codeabode.co">CodeAbode</a>'s site was updated just today and we have about 15+ leads on our first paying customer. Still a bit sluggish, but the library classes helped a lot. Now that I constructed a team for CodeAbode as well, things should move smoothly.</p>

<p>I've learned a lot about team management. It is really hard, and I have a pile of books on psychology and remote work on my desk. But with practice comes experience and it can only help me in the long run.</p>

<p>The last thing I need to kick into full gear would be my research work at <a href="https://aios.foundation">AIOS</a>. Since it's just me working on the current paper, things feel reallly sluggish and progress feels slow. However, once I force myself to move along a little bit things should get much better.</p>

<p>I also want to say that now I will repurpose this blog. I don't expect anyone to find any useful information on here now, instead it will just consist of a random bunch of my thoughts. I am curious as to who's gonna look at this blog, so I might put Google Analytics on here in the future. If you truly love FOSS like I do, you'll have an adblocker and probably be reading through <code>w3m</code>.</p>

<p>It took me two months and eight days to realize how important convenience is to me. In mid-February, I received an SSD to replace the outdated spinning disk in my laptop. Having used <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> on my laptop since I first installed Linux, I thought it would be a good idea to try out <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>. Initially, the setup was a bit tedious, but once I got started, the user experience was fantastic: packages installed almost instantly, the computer was quick and nimble in its computations, and the software I needed was readily available.</p>

<p>However, it didn't take long to realize that <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> wasn't well-suited for all situations. The operating system struggled with a higher number of packages and computationally intensive operations. For example, setting up a cryptodisk increased my boot time to about two minutes, and after installing LibreOffice, it took much longer to install additional packages. I eventually had to create a chroot just to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://mojolang.org">Mojo</a>, and <a href="https://checkra.in">checkra1n</a> on my iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> is only ideal for specific use cases. The decision to remove GNU C extensions reinforces the importance of application portability and offers users a choice, but it also sacrifices usability when working with advanced applications. For instance, kdenlive crashed during an assignment for my class and would segfault every time I tried to load it again. After discussing the issue with the developers, I realized that I had a bad build, which might not even be the developers' fault â€“ this incident made me appreciate the simplicity of using a more common Linux distribution.</p>

<p>One aspect of <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> that I did appreciate was the manual pages. They were far better than any other distro I've used, providing detailed descriptions of how to use the software installed on my computer. This made it easy to find what I needed without having to consult the ArchWiki all the time. If it weren't for the need to work with applications linked to the GNU C library, I might have stuck with <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> just for the manual pages.</p>

<p>I didn't want to go back to my previous lightweight and easy-to-use Linux distribution. Instead, I opted for <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a>, a Debian distribution without systemd that is a bit lighter. The installer didn't take long, and my system was ready to use without any significant issues. My laptop now boots faster, although I did have to resolve some annoyances with the initramfs due to unclear instructions in the refractainstaller. <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a> seems to work well, and I was able to set up my minimal bspwm environment and transfer my old files relatively quickly. However, I do miss the 160 MB of RAM usage my laptop had on idle with <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>. <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a>'s caching increased my idle usage by almost 100 MB.</p>

<p>In conclusion, neither <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a> nor <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> is a perfect solution, but the need for practicality outweighs my desire to be minimal. While I enjoyed the minimalism of <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine</a>, the convenience and faster boot times of <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a> ultimately won me over.</p>

On Turks &amp; Caicos
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202403311356.14# -->
<div class="subtitle">March 31, 2024 &mdash;

<!-- text begin -->

<p>During a recent vacation to the Turks and Caicos Islands, I couldn't help but notice the profound impact of British imperialism on the islands, despite the relaxing and enjoyable nature of the trip.</p>

<p>The cost of living in the Turks and Caicos was remarkably high, particularly in tourist areas. For instance, a container of yogurt cost $15, a half-day island tour was priced at $1300, and a plot of land exceeded a million dollars. These prices led me to wonder about the daily lives of the local population.</p>

<p>Upon visiting grocery stores frequented by locals, such as Sunny Foods, the stark contrast between the middle class and working class became apparent. Locals resided in smaller, more affordable housing, and the prices in these areas were significantly lower and not inflated for tourists. This discovery was made while searching for Indian food in the area. The disparity in prices is not unique to my observation; bread is 73.4% more expensive in the Turks and Caicos compared to the United States, and on average, the islands are 26.7% more expensive than the U.S.</p>

<p>It's also noteworthy that the GDP per capita in the Turks and Caicos is 65% lower than in the United States, and the minimum wage is only $8 per hour. A gallon of milk costs $20, requiring more than two hours of labor to afford. During the pandemic, milk prices were $10, and the minimum wage was $6.25.</p>

<p>The islands import all of their goods and impose a 30% duty on imports. The Turks and Caicos have minimal industry, importing $800 million worth of goods while exporting only $2.6 million. On the island of Providenciales, there are no factories, only shops, and a significant number of trees separating houses sold as plots. The west side of the island is where locals reside, with smaller houses in closer proximity, while the east side features sprawling real estate owned by venture capitalists.</p>

<p>These economic characteristics are common among British colonies, as the monarch imposes heavy import taxes on its colonies to sustain their own wealth.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Turks and Caicos have no income tax, property tax, or capital gains tax, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy who profit from the rapidly increasing real estate prices as beaches become increasingly privatized. The roads are dusty, traffic lights are nonexistent, and vehicles use both miles and kilometersâ€”but the primary concern seems to be ensuring that the rich can maintain their flow of money.</p>

<p>Similar to other semi-feudal colonies, the bourgeoisie do not identify with the colony but instead use it as a means of exchange or storage.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed the unique experiences of brushing my teeth with tree twigs and witnessing breathtaking sunrises on the beach, I believe it is crucial to address the neocolonialism present in the Turks and Caicos and allow them to develop their own industry. As the inflation rate continues to rise, it will become increasingly difficult for the working class to survive on the islands. It is time to end British imperialism!</p>

LUKS Alpine Setup

<p>Two weeks ago, my friend gave me his SSD because the hard drive on my laptop was failing. Without much difficulty, I was able to replace the drive even though it was my first time. Since I've used <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> for more than a year, I decided it was time to give <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> a try, which is notoriously famous for being one of the smallest linux distros. Since I couldn't find a well documented guide to install Alpine with disk encryption, I made one myself.</p>

<p>The harder part was figuring out how to install Alpine Linux with disk encryption on a MBR system. With that, let's get started.</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloading and burning Alpine to a USB</li>
<li>Setting up the live environment</li>
<li>Creating the crypt disk</li>
<li>Mounting and installing</li>
<li>Chrooting and rebooting</li>
</ol>

<p>This guide is based heavily off of <a href="https://www.msiism.org/files/doc/alpine-linux-fde-custom.html">this guide</a>, but it required a significant amount of trial and error before I got the commands working correctly. The purpose of this guide is to bring that one up to date.</p>

<h4>Download and burn Alpine</h4>

<p>The first, most obvious step is to obtain an Alpine ISO. These can be found on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">their website</a>. </p>

<p>If you are on linux, you can burn the ISO using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/path/to/alpine.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>Where alpine.iso points to the iso and /dev/sdX points to the USB. On Windows, use <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">balenaEtcher</a> or <a href="https://rufus.ie">Rufus</a>.</p>

<p>Now, just boot into the USB using the specific function key your board uses.</p>

<h4>Set up the environment</h4>

<p>You want to run the following command until it starts to setup users and partition disks:</p>

<pre><code>setup-alpine
</code></pre>

<p>It should take care of most of the manual setup. CTRL+C to exit once you get to that point. If you have trouble with WiFi hardware as I do on my system, you want to issue a combination of the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>setup-interfaces
# if you still can't connect afterward
ip link set wlan0 up
ip link set eth0 down
rc-service networking restart
</code></pre>

<p>After obtaining an IP address, you can proceed with the <code>setup-alpine</code> command. </p>

<p>Now, add the necessary packages:</p>

<pre><code>apk add cryptsetup e2fsprogs grub grub-bios lvm2 mkinitfs util-linux
</code></pre>

<h4>Create the crypt disk</h4>

<p>Randomize the disk prior to running any cryptsetup commands.</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>Subsitute /dev/sda with your main disk. This command takes some time, so keep yourself busy with some other activity. I went out on the snow.</p>

<p>Write your partition table using fdisk or cfdisk. Create a partition that starts from a sector far away from the boot signature, such as 2048. If your device sets the default to a double digit value, manually set it to 2048.</p>

<p>Scan for the new device nodes:</p>

<pre><code>mdev -s
</code></pre>

<p>Setup the container, replacing "name" with any string of your choice:</p>

<pre><code>cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 name
pvcreate /dev/mapper/name

vgcreate vg0 /dev/mapper/name
</code></pre>

<p>Now create logical volumes. I made one for root and for home but you can make as many as you want. </p>

<pre><code>lvcreate -L 2G vg0 -n swap
lvcreate -L 30G vg0 -n root
lvcreate -l 100%FREE vg0 -n home
</code></pre>

<p>Format them:</p>

<pre><code>mkswap -L alpine-swap /dev/vg0/swap
mkfs.ext4 -L alpine-root /dev/vg0/root
mkfs.ext4 -L alpine-home /dev/vg0/home

swapon /dev/vg0/swap
</code></pre>

<h4>Mount and install</h4>

<p>Due to <code>setup-alpine</code> having configured everything else for you, all that needs to happen now is mounting the disk and installing files.</p>

<pre><code>mount -t ext4 /dev/vg0/root /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mount -t ext4 /dev/vg0/home /mnt/home
</code></pre>

<p>And account for any additional partitions you may have created.</p>

<p>Use the setup-disk command:</p>

<pre><code>setup-disk -m sys /mnt
</code></pre>

<h4>Chroot and reboot</h4>

<p>And now your task is quite simple. </p>

<pre><code>mount --rbind /proc /mnt/proc
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys

chroot /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>Grab the UUID of the disk:</p>

<pre><code>blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sda1 &gt;&gt; /etc/default/gnvrub
</code></pre>

<p>Set the file to the following:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_TIMEOUT=2
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=y
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=true
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="modules=sd-mod,usb-storage,ext4 cryptroot=UUID=283ca385-4c57-40f1-842b-6beda9c3daf1 cryptdm=vault cryptkey quiet rootfstype=ext4"
</code></pre>

<p>Make a cryptkey to avoid entering the password twice on boot:</p>

<pre><code>dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/crypto_keyfile.bin
chmod 000 /crypto_keyfile.bin
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /crypto_keyfile.bin

vi /etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf
# add the "cryptkey" flag to features
</code></pre>

<p>Generate an initfs:</p>

<pre><code>mkinitfs -c /etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf kernel_version
</code></pre>

<p>Choose the latest kernel version from the following:</p>

<pre><code>ls /lib/modules
</code></pre>

<p>Now install GRUB</p>

<pre><code>grub-install /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Enable swap:</p>

<pre><code>printf 'UUID=%s  swap  swap  defaults  0 0\n' "$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vg0/swap)" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
rc-update add swap boot
</code></pre>

<p>Create a normal user: </p>

<pre><code>setup-user -a -g 'audio video cdrom netdev'
</code></pre>

<p>And reboot.</p>

<h4>After installation</h4>

<p>First, ensure you have access to the repositories you want:</p>

<pre><code>vi /etc/apk/repositories
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you live under a rock, you will need graphical programs such as a web browser. </p>

<pre><code>setup-xorg-base
</code></pre>

<p>After you have xfce4 or some UI working, you can proceed to install whatever WM your browser you use. The following drivers will be useful:</p>

<pre><code>apk add xf86-input-evdev wireless-tools wpa_supplicant linux-firmware-i915
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for the most part your system is ready to use. Your system will be fast; but MUSL will not permit you to use most packages normally.</p>

<p>The past weekend was a whirlwind of coding, learning, and teamwork at HackTCNJ 2024. It was my first hackathon experience, and I'm still processing the rollercoaster of emotions and insights that came with it.</p>

<p>Firstly, I quickly understood how different in person hackathons were from the virtual competitions I had taken part in prior to this. After trying both USACO and PClassic it occured to me that I had no inherent interest in solving algorithmic problems; it feels too far removed from the actual importance of programming and innovation; rather feels like a math test. Even though these competitions are highly prestigious, hackathons are far more applicable to the business world and my interest in programming as there is significantly more room for innovation.</p>

<p>The hackathon felt very immersive and was very motivating. I am very enthusiastic about Major League Hacking in general and appreciated the environment they provided with free food, conducive workspace, and no costs to participants even though the event was held in person. </p>

<p>The chief benefit of hackathons is the networking, in my opinion. I met the <a href="https://ruslug.org">Rutgers Student Linux User Group</a> president at the hackathon and we discussed Linux, FOSS, and the like. I met groups who built various sorts of projects: a radar, an AI webcam-based mouse, a 2d game with physics, a truth table generator... A huge variety of people from different backgrounds making a variety of different projects. </p>

<p>Prior to the event, my team and I decided to tackle a seemingly insurmountable challenge: building an operating system from scratch. In hindsight, it was an overly ambitious project for a hackathon, but we managed to make some progress, including creating a VGA driver, porting parts of libc, and delving into memory management.</p>

<p>Throughout this project, I was reminded once again of the importance of perseverance and embracing the slow, incremental improvements that come with tackling complex problems which was a theme that resonated from my 3d renderer project, as well. It's easy to feel discouraged when progress seems slow, but each small step forward is a testament to our growing understanding and skill.</p>

<p>As we worked on our OS, I couldn't help but notice that the winning teams had taken a different approach. They focused on solving specific, real-world problems rather than attempting to build something as complex as an operating system. For instance, the winning high school team created an innovative solution called "Expand-A-Conda," which used the pre-existing NVIDIA MIT-B5 model to detect earthquake survivors and deploy a simple, expanding plastic bag to help locate them.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the Expand-A-Conda team didn't develop their own AI model; instead, they leveraged an existing one and combined it with a relatively straightforward hardware component. This illustrates the power of focusing on practical problem-solving rather than striving for technical complexity for its own sake.</p>

<p>This experience taught me the value of focusing on problem-solving and applying existing skills to create practical solutions. While our OS project was impressive in its technical complexity, it lacked the immediate impact and relevance that the winning projects demonstrated.</p>

<p>Looking back, I realize that this lesson is applicable not only to hackathons but also to the broader world of entrepreneurship and innovation. Teams that identify and address pressing problems are more likely to gain traction and succeed than those that focus solely on pushing the boundaries of technology for its own sake.</p>

<p>As I prepare for my next hackathon, CJCP Hacks, I'm eager to apply these insights and work on a project that balances technical complexity with real-world relevance. My team and I have already started planning our strategy, and I'm excited to see what we can create in just 12 hours. </p>

<p>In the meantime, I'll be working on improving my website and addressing some technical issues, such as the date formatting problem I've encountered with BashBlog on Alpine Linux. Despite these challenges, I remain optimistic and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
