<p>After days of work, I have finally released a sample version of my curriculum that are taught in my classes. It can be accessed <a href="/SampleCurriculum.pdf">here</a>. My reasons for creating this curriculum are as follows:
- For parents to get a general idea of what is being taught
- To improve my own organization
- To establish a set of guidelines for any instructors I hire/volunteer for me. </p>

<h4>My ambitions</h4>

<p>I really want to take this far; I want other high school students like myself who are passionate about education and computer science in some way or the other to aid our future generation in experience. Not only will it help the students, it will likely help the instructors more, as they will improve their knowledge and will become better at explaining. I believe anyone can work with me on this project in any way, even if they don't know anything about programming or circuitry, because a lot of this involves developing intution of both the student and their instructor and improving problem solving. </p>

<p>I also want to expand this into other areas like math, finance, and economics, as those are among my favorite subjects. However, this may be more of a long term goal due to my constraints and amount of customers. The potential amount of customers is much higher because there is a lot of push by parents for these topics and we have a higher chance of appealing to the parents because of our specific tailoring. That being said, the market is also highly competitive and it is very easy for other businesses to be established. As competition is unavoidable, a good solution may include acquisition or developing better intangible assets. However, this is out of the scope of my business for now.</p>

<h4>Join!</h4>

<p>I want to establish as wide a network of teachers and students as possible because I really believe in tailor-based education. If you are interested in learning or teaching, whether virtually or in person, please <a href="mailto:rahejaom@outlook.com">mail me</a>. </p>

<h4>Other projects</h4>

<p>The most important project that comes to mind is my petiton for improved privacy laws, which needs a formal signing process. I will code a server based CGI script to hold form responses in a CSV soon, but I need my school administrators to allow me to advertise in school so I can gain traction. Me and my team are very excited for the potential of this project and are hoping we can get this to pass in the New Jersey senate.</p>

<p>I have additionally started learning latin due to its various applications in English and Spanish and so that I can better understand latin root words on the SAT. While that was my reason to start learning latin, now I am genuinely interested in the language and want to improve my language learning as well. I am using Hans H. Ørberg's Lingua Latina I textbook so that I can best improve my knowledge and learning ability by using the natural method. It's quite interesting, because I'm picking up the language the same way I picked up my native language, and that really affects my ability to speak, read, and write in it. I suggest all language learners start with the natural method if possible, because it is the most effective, as per my understanding. </p>

On Turks &amp; Caicos
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202403311356.14# -->
<div class="subtitle">March 31, 2024 &mdash; 
Om Raheja

<!-- text begin -->

<p>During a recent vacation to the Turks and Caicos Islands, I couldn't help but notice the profound impact of British imperialism on the islands, despite the relaxing and enjoyable nature of the trip.</p>

<p>The cost of living in the Turks and Caicos was remarkably high, particularly in tourist areas. For instance, a container of yogurt cost $15, a half-day island tour was priced at $1300, and a plot of land exceeded a million dollars. These prices led me to wonder about the daily lives of the local population.</p>

<p>Upon visiting grocery stores frequented by locals, such as Sunny Foods, the stark contrast between the middle class and working class became apparent. Locals resided in smaller, more affordable housing, and the prices in these areas were significantly lower and not inflated for tourists. This discovery was made while searching for Indian food in the area. The disparity in prices is not unique to my observation; bread is 73.4% more expensive in the Turks and Caicos compared to the United States, and on average, the islands are 26.7% more expensive than the U.S.</p>

<p>It's also noteworthy that the GDP per capita in the Turks and Caicos is 65% lower than in the United States, and the minimum wage is only $8 per hour. A gallon of milk costs $20, requiring more than two hours of labor to afford. During the pandemic, milk prices were $10, and the minimum wage was $6.25.</p>

<p>The islands import all of their goods and impose a 30% duty on imports. The Turks and Caicos have minimal industry, importing $800 million worth of goods while exporting only $2.6 million. On the island of Providenciales, there are no factories, only shops, and a significant number of trees separating houses sold as plots. The west side of the island is where locals reside, with smaller houses in closer proximity, while the east side features sprawling real estate owned by venture capitalists.</p>

<p>These economic characteristics are common among British colonies, as the monarch imposes heavy import taxes on its colonies to sustain their own wealth.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Turks and Caicos have no income tax, property tax, or capital gains tax, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy who profit from the rapidly increasing real estate prices as beaches become increasingly privatized. The roads are dusty, traffic lights are nonexistent, and vehicles use both miles and kilometers—but the primary concern seems to be ensuring that the rich can maintain their flow of money.</p>

<p>Similar to other semi-feudal colonies, the bourgeoisie do not identify with the colony but instead use it as a means of exchange or storage.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed the unique experiences of brushing my teeth with tree twigs and witnessing breathtaking sunrises on the beach, I believe it is crucial to address the neocolonialism present in the Turks and Caicos and allow them to develop their own industry. As the inflation rate continues to rise, it will become increasingly difficult for the working class to survive on the islands. It is time to end British imperialism!</p>

<h1>My First Post</h1>

<p>I thought I would setup <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">BashBlog</a> because it provides a nice alternative to social media. Not that I use any of that, I have no accounts on any major platforms. I might include a list of all the pages I've deleted my accounts from later.</p>

<p>I'm not going to waste your time here. I'll divide it up into sections of what I've done and why.</p>

<h2>BashBlog</h2>

<p>I attempted to make my own blogger in bash. After a few minutes, I realized its a lot more effort than it's worth, so I began looking for "blog generators". I found <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/create-static-blog-linux-terminal-with-bashblog/">this article</a> after a little searching, downloaded it and started writing this post in markdown.</p>

<p>Once I got onto the GitHub page, it didn't take me more than a few seconds to recognize the author, cfenollosa! He was the one who made the famous <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial">os-tutorial</a> to make your own operating system from scratch a while ago. For those of you who understand the value of his tutorial, there need be no explanation as to why this was included in my blog post.</p>

<h2>Ice Skating!</h2>

<p>This weekend I tried ice skating. Can't say it was easy, I hurt my knee and fell at least 20 times... I learned a lot, though. I was very eager to leave the railing and try to skate on my own, which is the likely cause of me falling so much, but if I didn't let go I don't think I would have learned otherwise.</p>

<p>Firstly, I have injuries all over my legs, mostly from the skates. I readjusted my skate multiple times in the short timespan I was at the rink, and even after readjustment I was unable to bend my knees to accelerate properly. It's likely this is more my fault than the skates, so I'll experiment a little before I decide rental skates are bad in general. It might just be worth it to spend $200 and get a nice pair if anyone is actually serious about it, which I am not.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I dislike individual sports. There's no reason why, but it just seems to get boring after some time. I suppose I am a swimmer, but there is definitely a significant amount of teamwork involved in swimming, as we are organized as a team and we make sacrifices to help others achieve their dreams and we cheer each other on during their swims. I don't believe I can make any judgement of ice skating yet, but from my experience, casual ice skating is really fun to do with your friends, maybe not a team sport but especially in the early stages a lot of teamwork. That being said, I may further my interest in it.</p>

<h2>SEC parser</h2>

<p>I started working on a parser that obtains data right from the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation">EDGAR API</a> because I'm done with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com">Yahoo Finance</a> and other ripoffs. I want a high quality, valuation based investment software without the fancy graphs and EPS before <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/103101.asp">pro forma earnings</a>. Not only that, the forward ratios and the TTM's throw me off all the time. It also requires a premium subscription to pay for financials past 1 year. Of course, it makes them money so its justified, but that software is not meant for me.</p>

<p>You could say I could resort to Nasdaq or some other official source. I intend to parse those sources for their dividend history and other information not available easily on EDGAR, but I want as accurate data as possible, even if that means I sacrifice a little precision with the number of outstanding shares and whatnot.</p>

<p>There are no ETAs or pull requests or anything, as with my other projects. I will get my git hosted soon and then it will be up, but I'm working on this solely out of my leisure, with my friend. </p>

General Reflection

<p>It is currently late at night, and instead of sleeping, I am up writing this blog post. I'm likely to wake up the next morning in utter confusion of what I have wrote here tonight.</p>

<h4>BashBlog (continued)</h4>

<p>I tried to configure bashblog to work better, by perhaps intregrating the blog and the frontpage together, but such a project is not for me. I don't want to poke around with the internals of this 1,000 line script any more than I've done already. If I feel like pursuing this later, you'll see the site look a lot more unified and improved.</p>

<p>There also seems to be this weird glitch with an unnamed post in my blog, which caused the timestamp "January 08, 2024" to randomly appear at the top. I don't know how to fix it yet, but I will because I don't like it. That being said, once the front page hits its post limit, it may also disappear.</p>

<p>That being said, I probably will unify the CSS in some way later, and will definitely work on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) first. </p>

<h4>FBLA Summit</h4>

<p>I went to a <a href="https://fbla.org">Future Business Leaders of America</a> regional summit on Friday, and I learned quite a bit. Let me sum it up for you: 
- I improved my confidence a lot more, because of the networking and law session that I chose. I can't say I liked one more than the other, as I met people from vastly different environments who had a keen interest in the business world and who also would like to make new friends. The law one was my favorite, because it enforced some of the concepts I was taught in my <a href="https://jsa.org">JSA</a> experience, and how statistics along with theoretical makes your argument more convincing.
- I gained a lot of useful knowledge and contacts. More than business related knowledge, I think I gained a new outlook on life. I came up with a better process to present myself in the professional world involving a set of rigid core values, which I followed already but going to summit helped me enforce those values. I met people who could help me accomplish my hopes and dreams and saved their contact information.
- I had fun. It's not everyday I get to take time off from school, much less I get to meet new people. I don't dislike school, but a break is appreciated from time to time. Alongside of being a professional summit, it was generally a place for me to be social and for me and my friends to enjoy ourselves.</p>

<h4>Personality Change</h4>

<p>Think it's kind of strange, but I'm picking up on developments in my own personality over time. I don't know how common this is or anyone else who notices changes like these, but I thought I would write about it anyways, since it seems interesting.</p>

<p>A quick google search of personality change doesn't yield much, except for the bipolar disorder, and the like. I am highly doubtful that there is any correlation between my experience and mental disorders, but instead a response to my environment.</p>

<p>As time goes on, it seems as if I idolize things or people much less. I recall at the start of this school year, I was very disappointed to find out that I would not be able to spend as much time with a friend from a neighboring district. At the time, she meant the entire world to me, and I'm glad that I was able to express that even though it took me a few days to get all my thoughts and emotions out.</p>

<p>Eventually, it came to a time where we would not be able to meet each other for almost a month at a time, which at the beginning was pretty degrading on my emotional health, but as time passed, those emotions started to disappear. In fact, the first time around, it seemed as if the inverse had occured, that I hadn't met her in so long, that I didn't want to meet her at all. I didn't want those powerful emotions to be invoked again.</p>

<p>And when I met her after that, it was as if I was a different person. I became completely distant and she wasn't sure what to do with me, which is funny in retrospect. The pattern continued, and by the end of this arbitrary cycle my interactions with her became completely distorted, but in a more positive manner.</p>

<p>These interactions, in fact, are what helped me to realize this change. A few months ago, maybe in the start of September, I was more reserved, very honest and didn't really say much other than deep talk. Now, I wouldn't say I'm the complete opposite, but I'm much more outgoing and a burst of energy. It's easier for me to form interactions this way, now that my confidence has improved, which came from a lot of public speaking in JSA. My interaction type in September wasn't bad, it was just less like myself. I'm a lot more goofy than most people are.</p>

<p>That brings me to another point. It was commonly accepted in my area that being goofy was a simple way to protect yourself from real emotions. In retrospect, that is partially true if you are concealing your real emotions, but my heart desires me to do stupid things and make stupid jokes, so that itself is part of my personality. Whether it protects myself from "real emotions", or is negative in general and lowers my reputation or whatever, it doesn't matter in the end because this new interaction type has made me a lot happier and has definitely improved my confidence.</p>

<p>As another example, I had this other close friend who I wasn't able to understand, and was under the severe misconception that she disliked me because she wanted to get work done during free study. Now, I spent the majority of my school day with her, knowing her only for 2 months but we had already gotten so close together, irrespective of our differences. The next day, I went to school without talking to her, and felt like garbage. I decided to tell another friend how I was feeling, even though we weren't that close. It eased the pain a little. The next day came, and it hurt a lot, but this time a little less. I quickly moved to make new friends because I realized that if I continued to get hurt through my lack of interaction with her I wouldn't last very long.</p>

<p>A few days later, I wasn't able to take it anymore, because she was sitting right in front of me and doing her work during free study. On a completely divided basis, I decided to go sit next to her and finish my work, not knowing what else to do. And so I made up a stupid excuse to sit next to her, and she saw right through it... but I sat there anyways and didn't say anything and just finished my work.</p>

<p>She looked at me a couple of times, confused, and scrolled through some reels on her phone. I glanced at her from time to time but I was bent on finishing my work, and that's what I did for the most part. Eventually she saw a funny reel and showed me and we both started laughing, and it reduced the intensity of the mood a lot. By the end of it, I asked her if she was mad at me, and after hearing her response I felt significantly relieved.</p>

<p>I did not sit with her with the intention that the conflict would be resolved. It was a risky decision and could have hurt me potentially, but I was confident that I could take the risk, knowing very little about her emotions, I did.</p>

<p>To simplify, it seems as if my personality development has stemed from a confidence change. I can project much better, make jokes in front of a whole group of people, laugh at my own mistakes, and feel good too. At the beginning, I mentioned that I stopped idolizing people and things. For people, it came to me that I can form deep connections with any kind of people, I just have to stay confident throughout the process. </p>

<p>I'm also experiencing personality change in other parts, of my life, not just my connections. I stopped worrying about my grades and whether my GPA would permit me to go into any college, and started focusing more on enjoying the work I did at school. It wasn't necessarily easy nor is it anything I want to do, but I took an interest in it and the process of learning and my grades have reached much higher than they have before. </p>

<p>In swimming, I'm not always sure about whether I can beat the competition or my own personal records at all, but I've been working harder in practice since November, to increase my confidence as a swimmer. This can also be extended to other parts of my life, as my willingness to purchase stocks with my own hard-earned money (after <strong>thorough</strong> research), asking for letters of recommendation for various summer programs, and so forth. My personality change seems to be constructed out of a push for confidence, which definitely has created a lot of upsides and has also made me unrecognizable to my friend listed above, as well as my other friends, family, past teachers, and colleagues. I would infer then, that a confidence boost has a significant amount of indirect upsides through the modifications of my own physcology. However, I still have a lot of improvements to make, so I will continue to work on my confidence.</p>

LUKS Alpine Setup
</a></h3>

<div class="subtitle">February 28, 2024 &mdash;

<p>Two weeks ago, my friend gave me his SSD because the hard drive on my laptop was failing. Without much difficulty, I was able to replace the drive even though it was my first time. Since I've used <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> for more than a year, I decided it was time to give <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> a try, which is notoriously famous for being one of the smallest linux distros. Since I couldn't find a well documented guide to install Alpine with disk encryption, I made one myself.</p>

<p>The harder part was figuring out how to install Alpine Linux with disk encryption on a MBR system. With that, let's get started.</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloading and burning Alpine to a USB</li>
<li>Setting up the live environment</li>
<li>Creating the crypt disk</li>
<li>Mounting and installing</li>
<li>Chrooting and rebooting</li>
</ol>

<p>This guide is based heavily off of <a href="https://www.msiism.org/files/doc/alpine-linux-fde-custom.html">this guide</a>, but it required a significant amount of trial and error before I got the commands working correctly. The purpose of this guide is to bring that one up to date.</p>

<h4>Download and burn Alpine</h4>

<p>The first, most obvious step is to obtain an Alpine ISO. These can be found on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">their website</a>. </p>

<p>If you are on linux, you can burn the ISO using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/path/to/alpine.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>Where alpine.iso points to the iso and /dev/sdX points to the USB. On Windows, use <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">balenaEtcher</a> or <a href="https://rufus.ie">Rufus</a>.</p>

<p>Now, just boot into the USB using the specific function key your board uses.</p>

<h4>Set up the environment</h4>

<p>You want to run the following command until it starts to setup users and partition disks:</p>

<pre><code>setup-alpine
</code></pre>

<p>It should take care of most of the manual setup. CTRL+C to exit once you get to that point. If you have trouble with WiFi hardware as I do on my system, you want to issue a combination of the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>setup-interfaces
# if you still can't connect afterward
ip link set wlan0 up
ip link set eth0 down
rc-service networking restart
</code></pre>

<p>After obtaining an IP address, you can proceed with the <code>setup-alpine</code> command. </p>

<p>Now, add the necessary packages:</p>

<pre><code>apk add cryptsetup e2fsprogs grub grub-bios lvm2 mkinitfs util-linux
</code></pre>

<h4>Create the crypt disk</h4>

<p>Randomize the disk prior to running any cryptsetup commands.</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>Subsitute /dev/sda with your main disk. This command takes some time, so keep yourself busy with some other activity. I went out on the snow.</p>

<p>Write your partition table using fdisk or cfdisk. Create a partition that starts from a sector far away from the boot signature, such as 2048. If your device sets the default to a double digit value, manually set it to 2048.</p>

<p>Scan for the new device nodes:</p>

<pre><code>mdev -s
</code></pre>

<p>Setup the container, replacing "name" with any string of your choice:</p>

<pre><code>cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 name
pvcreate /dev/mapper/name

vgcreate vg0 /dev/mapper/name
</code></pre>

<p>Now create logical volumes. I made one for root and for home but you can make as many as you want. </p>

<pre><code>lvcreate -L 2G vg0 -n swap
lvcreate -L 30G vg0 -n root
lvcreate -l 100%FREE vg0 -n home
</code></pre>

<p>Format them:</p>

<pre><code>mkswap -L alpine-swap /dev/vg0/swap
mkfs.ext4 -L alpine-root /dev/vg0/root
mkfs.ext4 -L alpine-home /dev/vg0/home

swapon /dev/vg0/swap
</code></pre>

<h4>Mount and install</h4>

<p>Due to <code>setup-alpine</code> having configured everything else for you, all that needs to happen now is mounting the disk and installing files.</p>

<pre><code>mount -t ext4 /dev/vg0/root /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mount -t ext4 /dev/vg0/home /mnt/home
</code></pre>

<p>And account for any additional partitions you may have created.</p>

<p>Use the setup-disk command:</p>

<pre><code>setup-disk -m sys /mnt
</code></pre>

<h4>Chroot and reboot</h4>

<p>And now your task is quite simple. </p>

<pre><code>mount --rbind /proc /mnt/proc
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys

chroot /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>Grab the UUID of the disk:</p>

<pre><code>blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sda1 &gt;&gt; /etc/default/gnvrub
</code></pre>

<p>Set the file to the following:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_TIMEOUT=2
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=y
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=true
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="modules=sd-mod,usb-storage,ext4 cryptroot=UUID=283ca385-4c57-40f1-842b-6beda9c3daf1 cryptdm=vault cryptkey quiet rootfstype=ext4"
</code></pre>

<p>Make a cryptkey to avoid entering the password twice on boot:</p>

<pre><code>dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/crypto_keyfile.bin
chmod 000 /crypto_keyfile.bin
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /crypto_keyfile.bin

vi /etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf
# add the "cryptkey" flag to features
</code></pre>

<p>Generate an initfs:</p>

<pre><code>mkinitfs -c /etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf kernel_version
</code></pre>

<p>Choose the latest kernel version from the following:</p>

<pre><code>ls /lib/modules
</code></pre>

<p>Now install GRUB</p>

<pre><code>grub-install /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Enable swap:</p>

<pre><code>printf 'UUID=%s  swap  swap  defaults  0 0\n' "$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vg0/swap)" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
rc-update add swap boot
</code></pre>

<p>Create a normal user: </p>

<pre><code>setup-user -a -g 'audio video cdrom netdev'
</code></pre>

<p>And reboot.</p>

<h4>After installation</h4>

<p>First, ensure you have access to the repositories you want:</p>

<pre><code>vi /etc/apk/repositories
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you live under a rock, you will need graphical programs such as a web browser. </p>

<pre><code>setup-xorg-base
</code></pre>

<p>After you have xfce4 or some UI working, you can proceed to install whatever WM your browser you use. The following drivers will be useful:</p>

<pre><code>apk add xf86-input-evdev wireless-tools wpa_supplicant linux-firmware-i915
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for the most part your system is ready to use. Your system will be fast; but MUSL will not permit you to use most packages normally.</p>
