On Connection and Death

Although my face remained sealed, my thoughts whirred, wondering whether to comfort them or to express the heaviness I now felt, knowing that my friend may pass away significantly earlier than expected, only after watching the same suffering themself.

Over the past few months, I've been more exposed to the thought of mortality than I probably have the rest of my life. 

My [friend tragically passed](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2025/09/22/missing-plainsboro-nj-teen-found-dead-near-grovers-mill-road/86299976007/) [away in September](https://alanzheng.org). A particular individual's mom passed.

I found that one of my other friend's mom had also passed and his dad had re-married, which I neither think positively nor negatively of but consider it a means of moving on. 

At the end of the day, your value in life is determined by your interactions with your community and the people you're close with, because in the grand scheme of things they don't matter. Surely wealth matters and making an impact matters but those are two additional examples of things to focus on.

A person close to me once said that we're going to spend most of our life "corporate" anyway, so may as well have some fun along the way. 

I feel that connection doesn't really exist to the same level within my community; like, we may phone call a relative asking them to come, but we hardly spend time with most of them. At the same time, I'm grateful for bringing up in a place where I could intellectually develop, probably something that requires isolation as a part of its material conditions.

Consider this post more of an incoherent thought dump than a well thought out essay.
