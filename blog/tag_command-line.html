<p>As I was in the throes of configuring my mail client, I was jolted back to reality by the sight of my unfinished chemistry homework. Without a moment to lose, I seized the paper and gave it a quick once-over. It became apparent that I needed to meticulously label and number the axes of the graph.</p>

<p>For the x-axis, I had 38 points to mark. Swiftly, I assigned numbers from 0 to 14, allotting 2 boxes for each. The simplicity of this task spared me any complex mental gymnastics. However, the real challenge was yet to come.</p>

<p>The y-axis was a daunting grid of 50 boxes, needing to be numbered from -200 to 250. The thought of doing the calculations mentally was unappealing, to say the least. So, I turned to a more efficient solution - a bash script that would do the work for me in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>I promptly opened a new file and embedded the following script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
num=-200

while [ "$num" != 250 ] ; do
    echo $num
    num=$(expr $num + 9)
    read e
done
</code></pre>

<p>My task was simplified to merely reading a number and pressing enter to label the next cell.</p>

<p>This, I believe, is the true beauty of coding. It empowers you to automate simple tasks in a blink, saving precious time and effort that a machine can spare. While there are numerous reasons to create full-fledged programs, like the neovim I'm using for this post, the real value for an average person lies in these small yet significant automations.</p>

<p>This journey with the command line began two years ago and since then, my efficiency with technology has grown leaps and bounds. Why should I twiddle my thumbs waiting for Gmail to load, when I can swiftly navigate my emails using keyboard keys via the command line? Why waste a minute loading YouTube (or Invidious, for that matter) when I can simply run ytfzf from my local terminal, opening mpv to enjoy videos while multitasking on my homework?</p>

<p>So, here's to a safe and enlightening journey with bash scripting!</p>
