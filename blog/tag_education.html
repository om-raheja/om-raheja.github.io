<p>After days of work, I have finally released a sample version of my curriculum that are taught in my classes. It can be accessed <a href="/SampleCurriculum.pdf">here</a>. My reasons for creating this curriculum are as follows:
- For parents to get a general idea of what is being taught
- To improve my own organization
- To establish a set of guidelines for any instructors I hire/volunteer for me. </p>

<h4>My ambitions</h4>

<p>I really want to take this far; I want other high school students like myself who are passionate about education and computer science in some way or the other to aid our future generation in experience. Not only will it help the students, it will likely help the instructors more, as they will improve their knowledge and will become better at explaining. I believe anyone can work with me on this project in any way, even if they don't know anything about programming or circuitry, because a lot of this involves developing intution of both the student and their instructor and improving problem solving. </p>

<p>I also want to expand this into other areas like math, finance, and economics, as those are among my favorite subjects. However, this may be more of a long term goal due to my constraints and amount of customers. The potential amount of customers is much higher because there is a lot of push by parents for these topics and we have a higher chance of appealing to the parents because of our specific tailoring. That being said, the market is also highly competitive and it is very easy for other businesses to be established. As competition is unavoidable, a good solution may include acquisition or developing better intangible assets. However, this is out of the scope of my business for now.</p>

<h4>Join!</h4>

<p>I want to establish as wide a network of teachers and students as possible because I really believe in tailor-based education. If you are interested in learning or teaching, whether virtually or in person, please <a href="mailto:rahejaom@outlook.com">mail me</a>. </p>

<h4>Other projects</h4>

<p>The most important project that comes to mind is my petiton for improved privacy laws, which needs a formal signing process. I will code a server based CGI script to hold form responses in a CSV soon, but I need my school administrators to allow me to advertise in school so I can gain traction. Me and my team are very excited for the potential of this project and are hoping we can get this to pass in the New Jersey senate.</p>

<p>I have additionally started learning latin due to its various applications in English and Spanish and so that I can better understand latin root words on the SAT. While that was my reason to start learning latin, now I am genuinely interested in the language and want to improve my language learning as well. I am using Hans H. Ã˜rberg's Lingua Latina I textbook so that I can best improve my knowledge and learning ability by using the natural method. It's quite interesting, because I'm picking up the language the same way I picked up my native language, and that really affects my ability to speak, read, and write in it. I suggest all language learners start with the natural method if possible, because it is the most effective, as per my understanding. </p>
