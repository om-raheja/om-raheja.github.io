The Feeling of Learning

Quite literally, unlimited power.

---

Over the last few weeks, I've spent more of my focus on high school drama than I should've put into my organization. After having stronger negative feelings yesterday, I've decided to turn my focus to learning entirely instead of being reliant on the fragile relationships I form at school. Note that when I say learning entirely, I don't mean keeping busy as a way of avoiding the problem; I mean that my focus needs to shift onto skills that will help me in the long run. I don't necessarily need to worry so much about what's going on right now in terms of school.

My grades aren't exactly holding steady. As much as I try to study, they are barely able to stay afloat. Now that I'm on a 4 day weekend, I'm spending my time learning the difference between what I'm doing and what is actually necessary. For example, at [aquarc](https://aquarc.org) we've been avoiding the UI changes and adding a vocab quiz because it seemed like a "risky" feature. But that is the most important thing for us to do. In my reading of *The Design of Everyday Things*, I've started to focus more on building strong signifiers of anti-affordances and building a more feedback-intensive design. 

At [codeabode](https://codeabode.co), the importance of project-based design hit me. I've designed a worksheet once to target confusion points and I was rather hesitant to create one again because the user seemed to understand what was going on. In an effort to avoid giving "busywork," I instead focused on project-based learning and encouraged my student to build a calculator app, followed by a game where you avoid asteroids. I feel that targetting confusion points that arrive as the student tries on their own is more useful than giving worksheets like in AP Computer Science, where I had to predict the output of loops that made no sense. They were useful I guess, but I'm going to try this approach instead and see where it takes [codeabode](https://codeabode.co). Might be a complete failure, but who knows?
