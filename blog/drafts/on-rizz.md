On 'Rizz'

Note: This essay was made as a request from my friend and is for illustrative purposes only. I don't intend to hurt any person, group, ethnicity, gender, or such.

We started with the word charisma, and turned it into a slang that we use to make fun of each other. Not a day can pass in the hallway where I'm having a normal conversation and someone will shout out "w rizz". Even I'm guilty of doing this myself, albeit with better timing. So, what exactly defines "rizz"?

The best place to start would be at the origins; the word charisma, which was the original definition of rizz, can be simplified to a compliment for an attractive person through their appearance and their personality. The simplified, slang version of this word carries some of that meaning, but it appears to be slightly distorted.

Let's take a look at a specific example where I would use "w rizz". I have two close friends who identify as male and female, respectively. Since they don't interact often, when they do it is often humorous to use the phrase "w rizz" which often results in looks of disgust across the face of each other, and then results in the inability of them to meet each other eyes. However, this occurs so often that these effects are reduced, and the effects towards speaker, or I, is increased, which would likely be in the form of pain. However, these activities are still conducted by me and various people in our high school because the humor outweighs the pain.

However, there are also other examples. A simple wave, a simple hello, a quick conversation can all result in this phrase being uttered. Sometimes this is indirect, with a smirky nod, or a blunt affirmation of the dynamic that appears intimate by calling one of them the other's boyfriend. Living in the environment high schoolers live in, all of us are guilty of these gestures.

It appears as if "rizz" is more of a joking manner to demonstrate the word "charisma", although you'll often associate this phrase with people of lower intellect, like myself due to the immaturity of friendships with the opposing gender. In fact, the more respected and mature individuals wouldn't find this phrase funny, often because working with people of the opposite gender is so common for them, which shows how they have a better understanding of the real world.

This brings us to the real question: to "rizz", or not to "rizz"?
