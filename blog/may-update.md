May Update

It's been more than a month since my last blog post. In this month, the changes I've made would make me completely unrecognizable to myself from April.

---

I've placed a key emphasis on working with and potentially majoring in Computer Science, so that I can further my own abilities and gain stronger connections than if I worked with other generic businessmen. That being said, I am still pursuing the [Leangap](https://leangap.org) program. 

I've started by forming contributions to the [AIOS](https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS) project. I've met with the professor and wrote documentation, and I wrote no more than 2 paragraphs in the latest paper. This isn't much, but it is the foundation for all my contributions and it's provided me with connections I need to survive in the future.

I've improved my experience with neural networks and my fundamental understanding of how transformers work. I've almost wrapped up the calculus study behind it in KhanAcademy which facilitated my learning experience significantly, especially with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). 

To facilitate my understanding of neural networks and to be able to make improved contributions to this developing space, having improved battery life, and having less backache, I equipped myself with a brand new MacBook Pro. After using only Linux for more than 2 years, it feels quite strange to have to work with proprietary software so frequently. Initially, I didn't intend on configuring my new device beyond installing [brew](https://brew.sh), but now I have [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com), [oh my zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh), and [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai). Coming from linux where I focused on minimalism, taking a new attitude towards productivity helps me get my work done so much faster. That being said, I would like to return to Linux eventually.

I went to [HackMHS](https://hackmhs.com) and worked on [Fridge2Fit](https://git.rslp.org/omr/Fridge2Fit) myself. Being my 3rd hackathon, I've been able to apply my knowledge from my prior hackathons; I focused mostly on applied technologies; most of my code was just a wrapper around two existing models, neither of which were running locally. It was a good project, but I wasn't able to deploy or style my website in time. I have a cohesive understanding of what I need for a hackathon now; next time I want to walk away with more than just the "Best Domain" award.

Additionally, I've deployed a website to catalyze the growth of my teaching business, [CodeAbode](https://codeabode.co). Hopefully me and my team can start turning the investment into profits soon?

I plan to update this website with a new domain as soon as I am able to purchase one. They aren't expensive, but I don't want to burn out my wallet when other investments could be necessary.
