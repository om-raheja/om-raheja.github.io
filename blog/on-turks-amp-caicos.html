<p>During a recent vacation to the Turks and Caicos Islands, I couldn't help but notice the profound impact of British imperialism on the islands, despite the relaxing and enjoyable nature of the trip.</p>

<hr />

<p>The cost of living in the Turks and Caicos was remarkably high, particularly in tourist areas. For instance, a container of yogurt cost $15, a half-day island tour was priced at $1300, and a plot of land exceeded a million dollars. These prices led me to wonder about the daily lives of the local population.</p>

<p>Upon visiting grocery stores frequented by locals, such as Sunny Foods, the stark contrast between the middle class and working class became apparent. Locals resided in smaller, more affordable housing, and the prices in these areas were significantly lower and not inflated for tourists. This discovery was made while searching for Indian food in the area. The disparity in prices is not unique to my observation; bread is 73.4% more expensive in the Turks and Caicos compared to the United States, and on average, the islands are 26.7% more expensive than the U.S.</p>

<p>It's also noteworthy that the GDP per capita in the Turks and Caicos is 65% lower than in the United States, and the minimum wage is only $8 per hour. A gallon of milk costs $20, requiring more than two hours of labor to afford. During the pandemic, milk prices were $10, and the minimum wage was $6.25.</p>

<p>The islands import all of their goods and impose a 30% duty on imports. The Turks and Caicos have minimal industry, importing $800 million worth of goods while exporting only $2.6 million. On the island of Providenciales, there are no factories, only shops, and a significant number of trees separating houses sold as plots. The west side of the island is where locals reside, with smaller houses in closer proximity, while the east side features sprawling real estate owned by venture capitalists.</p>

<p>These economic characteristics are common among British colonies, as the monarch imposes heavy import taxes on its colonies to sustain their own wealth.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Turks and Caicos have no income tax, property tax, or capital gains tax, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy who profit from the rapidly increasing real estate prices as beaches become increasingly privatized. The roads are dusty, traffic lights are nonexistent, and vehicles use both miles and kilometersâ€”but the primary concern seems to be ensuring that the rich can maintain their flow of money.</p>

<p>Similar to other semi-feudal colonies, the bourgeoisie do not identify with the colony but instead use it as a means of exchange or storage.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed the unique experiences of brushing my teeth with tree twigs and witnessing breathtaking sunrises on the beach, I believe it is crucial to address the neocolonialism present in the Turks and Caicos and allow them to develop their own industry. As the inflation rate continues to rise, it will become increasingly difficult for the working class to survive on the islands. It is time to end British imperialism!</p>
