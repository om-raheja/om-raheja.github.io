Need for Speed

Every startup needs to go **fast**. How am I going to do that?
---

In the beginning of my professional career, every project I undertook would remain unfinished because I realized the difficulty of attaining perfection in that field. In fact, it was impossible. I remember designing a website and adding URL-http redirects when the initial product wasn't even finished. And I never finished that project, nor any others like it. After years, I finally realize where my obsession with perfection came from, and how I can help others like myself overcome it.

I've started focusing on the immediate problems. There's no sense of collective direction, or at least there are too many ways in which we are expanding which leads to procrastination. I think we need one defined, unified plan and bring people on board with it. 

In addition to that, I want to focus on cutting down procrastination, which is a prevalent problem for both me and my team. If I can simplify the aquarc playing field and help people manage their commitments effectively, I can help myself and others overcome procrastination.

Building aquarc isn't coding up a useful platform for high school students. It's a battle against all the problems high schoolers face, inside and outside the team. Time management being something that everyone sucks at, maybe that's a strong potential direction for aquarc once we mature at it.
