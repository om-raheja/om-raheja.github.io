<p>A beautiful, natural place. Plenty of hens and great beaches. But there's a lot to see under the surface and a lot I learned in my personal journey, too.</p>

<hr />

<p>Turks and Caicos and Hawaii are both expensive places to live. There isn't much information on the comparsion in detail. According to MyLifeElsewhere, Turks and Caicos is 35.8% more expensive than the US mainland and Hawaii is 26.9% more expensive. Generally, housing is cited as the most expensive due to its beautiful location.</p>

<p>The expensive housing causes significant urban poverty. In the cities there is a significant homeless population and people set up tents in slum-like districts. Outside the cities,  there doesn't tend to be much except the natural landscape. In general, the Hawaiian islands are more developed than Turks and Caicos. </p>

<p>Apart from that, it's a great place for travel. </p>

<hr />

<p>On a personal level, I finally grasped the concept of team management. Right around New Year's I felt frustrated with my inability to coordinate teams. After closing out Signal for a week, I read the following books:
1. Multipliers
2. The Five Dysfunctions
3. The Mom Test
4. Leading from Anywhere</p>

<p>The approach I'm taking now involves taking a step back and letting the ideas of others flow. I'm going to ask questions and drive debate while tying the work of others into the underlying organization. I also plan to spend the next week working with everyone individually and figuring out what they need to be successful. Some like to call, and some like a significant amount of space and a challenge. It'll take time for me to figure the detials out.</p>

<p>I decided to rigidify my schedule and divide my time into "blocks" right after I get home to avoid doomscrolling or wasting time. I feel like now that I'm back from break there isn't a lot of work I need to do personally but moreso adapt within the team. Now I can focus more on my hobbies or other development. The last thing I want to be is bored, so I'll grab a couple books of the shelf. The benefit of my break is a complete schedule reset. I need to do these more often.</p>

<p>Let's see how things pan out.</p>
