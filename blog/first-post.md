First Post

# My First Post
I thought I would setup [BashBlog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) because it provides a nice alternative to social media. Not that I use any of that, I have no accounts on any major platforms. I might include a list of all the pages I've deleted my accounts from later.

I'm not going to waste your time here. I'll divide it up into sections of what I've done and why.

## BashBlog
I attempted to make my own blogger in bash. After a few minutes, I realized its a lot more effort than it's worth, so I began looking for "blog generators". I found [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/create-static-blog-linux-terminal-with-bashblog/) after a little searching, downloaded it and started writing this post in markdown.

Once I got onto the GitHub page, it didn't take me more than a few seconds to recognize the author, cfenollosa! He was the one who made the famous [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) to make your own operating system from scratch a while ago. For those of you who understand the value of his tutorial, there need be no explanation as to why this was included in my blog post.

## Ice Skating!
This weekend I tried ice skating. Can't say it was easy, I hurt my knee and fell at least 20 times... I learned a lot, though. I was very eager to leave the railing and try to skate on my own, which is the likely cause of me falling so much, but if I didn't let go I don't think I would have learned otherwise.

Firstly, I have injuries all over my legs, mostly from the skates. I readjusted my skate multiple times in the short timespan I was at the rink, and even after readjustment I was unable to bend my knees to accelerate properly. It's likely this is more my fault than the skates, so I'll experiment a little before I decide rental skates are bad in general. It might just be worth it to spend $200 and get a nice pair if anyone is actually serious about it, which I am not.

Generally speaking, I dislike individual sports. There's no reason why, but it just seems to get boring after some time. I suppose I am a swimmer, but there is definitely a significant amount of teamwork involved in swimming, as we are organized as a team and we make sacrifices to help others achieve their dreams and we cheer each other on during their swims. I don't believe I can make any judgement of ice skating yet, but from my experience, casual ice skating is really fun to do with your friends, maybe not a team sport but especially in the early stages a lot of teamwork. That being said, I may further my interest in it.

## SEC parser
I started working on a parser that obtains data right from the [EDGAR API](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation) because I'm done with [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) and other ripoffs. I want a high quality, valuation based investment software without the fancy graphs and EPS before [pro forma earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/103101.asp). Not only that, the forward ratios and the TTM's throw me off all the time. It also requires a premium subscription to pay for financials past 1 year. Of course, it makes them money so its justified, but that software is not meant for me.

You could say I could resort to Nasdaq or some other official source. I intend to parse those sources for their dividend history and other information not available easily on EDGAR, but I want as accurate data as possible, even if that means I sacrifice a little precision with the number of outstanding shares and whatnot.

There are no ETAs or pull requests or anything, as with my other projects. I will get my git hosted soon and then it will be up, but I'm working on this solely out of my leisure, with my friend.
