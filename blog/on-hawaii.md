On Hawaii

A beautiful, natural place. Plenty of hens and great beaches. But there's a lot to see under the surface and a lot I learned in my personal journey, too.

Turks and Caicos and Hawaii are both expensive places to live. There isn't much information on the comparsion in detail. According to MyLifeElsewhere, Turks and Caicos is 35.8% more expensive than the US mainland and Hawaii is 26.9% more expensive. Generally, housing is cited as the most expensive due to its beautiful location.

The expensive housing causes significant urban poverty. In the cities there is a significant homeless population and people set up tents in slum-like districts. Outside the cities,  there doesn't tend to be much except the natural landscape. In general, the Hawaiian islands are more developed than Turks and Caicos. 

Apart from that, it's a great place for travel.

On a personal level, I finally grasped the concept of team management. Right around New Year's I felt frustrated with my inability to coordinate teams. After closing out Signal for a week, I read the following books:
1. Multipliers
2. The Five Dysfunctions
3. The Mom Test
4. Leading from Anywhere

The approach I'm taking now involves taking a step back and letting the ideas of others flow. I'm going to ask questions and drive debate while tying the work of others into the underlying organization. I also plan to spend the next week working with everyone individually and figuring out what they need to be successful. Some like to call, and some like a significant amount of space and a challenge. It'll take time for me to figure the detials out.

I decided to rigidify my schedule and divide my time into "blocks" right after I get home to avoid doomscrolling or wasting time. I feel like now that I'm back from break there isn't a lot of work I need to do personally but moreso adapt within the team. Now I can focus more on my hobbies or other development. The last thing I want to be is bored, so I'll grab a couple books of the shelf. The benefit of my break is a complete schedule reset. I need to do these more often.

Let's see how things pan out.
