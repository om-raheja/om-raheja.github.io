<p>It took me two months and eight days to realize how important convenience is to me. In mid-February, I received an SSD to replace the outdated spinning disk in my laptop. Having used <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> on my laptop since I first installed Linux, I thought it would be a good idea to try out <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>. Initially, the setup was a bit tedious, but once I got started, the user experience was fantastic: packages installed almost instantly, the computer was quick and nimble in its computations, and the software I needed was readily available.</p>

<p>However, it didn't take long to realize that <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> wasn't well-suited for all situations. The operating system struggled with a higher number of packages and computationally intensive operations. For example, setting up a cryptodisk increased my boot time to about two minutes, and after installing LibreOffice, it took much longer to install additional packages. I eventually had to create a chroot just to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://mojolang.org">Mojo</a>, and <a href="https://checkra.in">checkra1n</a> on my iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> is only ideal for specific use cases. The decision to remove GNU C extensions reinforces the importance of application portability and offers users a choice, but it also sacrifices usability when working with advanced applications. For instance, kdenlive crashed during an assignment for my class and would segfault every time I tried to load it again. After discussing the issue with the developers, I realized that I had a bad build, which might not even be the developers' fault â€“ this incident made me appreciate the simplicity of using a more common Linux distribution.</p>

<p>One aspect of <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> that I did appreciate was the manual pages. They were far better than any other distro I've used, providing detailed descriptions of how to use the software installed on my computer. This made it easy to find what I needed without having to consult the ArchWiki all the time. If it weren't for the need to work with applications linked to the GNU C library, I might have stuck with <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> just for the manual pages.</p>

<p>I didn't want to go back to my previous lightweight and easy-to-use Linux distribution. Instead, I opted for <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a>, a Debian distribution without systemd that is a bit lighter. The installer didn't take long, and my system was ready to use without any significant issues. My laptop now boots faster, although I did have to resolve some annoyances with the initramfs due to unclear instructions in the refractainstaller. <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a> seems to work well, and I was able to set up my minimal bspwm environment and transfer my old files relatively quickly. However, I do miss the 160 MB of RAM usage my laptop had on idle with <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>. <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a>'s caching increased my idle usage by almost 100 MB.</p>

<p>In conclusion, neither <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a> nor <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> is a perfect solution, but the need for practicality outweighs my desire to be minimal. While I enjoyed the minimalism of <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine</a>, the convenience and faster boot times of <a href="https://devuan.org">Devuan</a> ultimately won me over.</p>

LUKS Alpine Setup
</a></h3>

<p>Two weeks ago, my friend gave me his SSD because the hard drive on my laptop was failing. Without much difficulty, I was able to replace the drive even though it was my first time. Since I've used <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> for more than a year, I decided it was time to give <a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> a try, which is notoriously famous for being one of the smallest linux distros. Since I couldn't find a well documented guide to install Alpine with disk encryption, I made one myself.</p>

<p>The harder part was figuring out how to install Alpine Linux with disk encryption on a MBR system. With that, let's get started.</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloading and burning Alpine to a USB</li>
<li>Setting up the live environment</li>
<li>Creating the crypt disk</li>
<li>Mounting and installing</li>
<li>Chrooting and rebooting</li>
</ol>

<p>This guide is based heavily off of <a href="https://www.msiism.org/files/doc/alpine-linux-fde-custom.html">this guide</a>, but it required a significant amount of trial and error before I got the commands working correctly. The purpose of this guide is to bring that one up to date.</p>

<h4>Download and burn Alpine</h4>

<p>The first, most obvious step is to obtain an Alpine ISO. These can be found on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">their website</a>. </p>

<p>If you are on linux, you can burn the ISO using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/path/to/alpine.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>Where alpine.iso points to the iso and /dev/sdX points to the USB. On Windows, use <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">balenaEtcher</a> or <a href="https://rufus.ie">Rufus</a>.</p>

<p>Now, just boot into the USB using the specific function key your board uses.</p>

<h4>Set up the environment</h4>

<p>You want to run the following command until it starts to setup users and partition disks:</p>

<pre><code>setup-alpine
</code></pre>

<p>It should take care of most of the manual setup. CTRL+C to exit once you get to that point. If you have trouble with WiFi hardware as I do on my system, you want to issue a combination of the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>setup-interfaces
# if you still can't connect afterward
ip link set wlan0 up
ip link set eth0 down
rc-service networking restart
</code></pre>

<p>After obtaining an IP address, you can proceed with the <code>setup-alpine</code> command. </p>

<p>Now, add the necessary packages:</p>

<pre><code>apk add cryptsetup e2fsprogs grub grub-bios lvm2 mkinitfs util-linux
</code></pre>

<h4>Create the crypt disk</h4>

<p>Randomize the disk prior to running any cryptsetup commands.</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>Subsitute /dev/sda with your main disk. This command takes some time, so keep yourself busy with some other activity. I went out on the snow.</p>

<p>Write your partition table using fdisk or cfdisk. Create a partition that starts from a sector far away from the boot signature, such as 2048. If your device sets the default to a double digit value, manually set it to 2048.</p>

<p>Scan for the new device nodes:</p>

<pre><code>mdev -s
</code></pre>

<p>Setup the container, replacing "name" with any string of your choice:</p>

<pre><code>cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 name
pvcreate /dev/mapper/name

vgcreate vg0 /dev/mapper/name
</code></pre>

<p>Now create logical volumes. I made one for root and for home but you can make as many as you want. </p>

<pre><code>lvcreate -L 2G vg0 -n swap
lvcreate -L 30G vg0 -n root
lvcreate -l 100%FREE vg0 -n home
</code></pre>

<p>Format them:</p>

<pre><code>mkswap -L alpine-swap /dev/vg0/swap
mkfs.ext4 -L alpine-root /dev/vg0/root
mkfs.ext4 -L alpine-home /dev/vg0/home

swapon /dev/vg0/swap
</code></pre>

<h4>Mount and install</h4>

<p>Due to <code>setup-alpine</code> having configured everything else for you, all that needs to happen now is mounting the disk and installing files.</p>

<pre><code>mount -t ext4 /dev/vg0/root /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mount -t ext4 /dev/vg0/home /mnt/home
</code></pre>

<p>And account for any additional partitions you may have created.</p>

<p>Use the setup-disk command:</p>

<pre><code>setup-disk -m sys /mnt
</code></pre>

<h4>Chroot and reboot</h4>

<p>And now your task is quite simple. </p>

<pre><code>mount --rbind /proc /mnt/proc
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys

chroot /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>Grab the UUID of the disk:</p>

<pre><code>blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sda1 &gt;&gt; /etc/default/gnvrub
</code></pre>

<p>Set the file to the following:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_TIMEOUT=2
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=y
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=true
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="modules=sd-mod,usb-storage,ext4 cryptroot=UUID=283ca385-4c57-40f1-842b-6beda9c3daf1 cryptdm=vault cryptkey quiet rootfstype=ext4"
</code></pre>

<p>Make a cryptkey to avoid entering the password twice on boot:</p>

<pre><code>dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/crypto_keyfile.bin
chmod 000 /crypto_keyfile.bin
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /crypto_keyfile.bin

vi /etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf
# add the "cryptkey" flag to features
</code></pre>

<p>Generate an initfs:</p>

<pre><code>mkinitfs -c /etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf kernel_version
</code></pre>

<p>Choose the latest kernel version from the following:</p>

<pre><code>ls /lib/modules
</code></pre>

<p>Now install GRUB</p>

<pre><code>grub-install /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Enable swap:</p>

<pre><code>printf 'UUID=%s  swap  swap  defaults  0 0\n' "$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vg0/swap)" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
rc-update add swap boot
</code></pre>

<p>Create a normal user: </p>

<pre><code>setup-user -a -g 'audio video cdrom netdev'
</code></pre>

<p>And reboot.</p>

<h4>After installation</h4>

<p>First, ensure you have access to the repositories you want:</p>

<pre><code>vi /etc/apk/repositories
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you live under a rock, you will need graphical programs such as a web browser. </p>

<pre><code>setup-xorg-base
</code></pre>

<p>After you have xfce4 or some UI working, you can proceed to install whatever WM your browser you use. The following drivers will be useful:</p>

<pre><code>apk add xf86-input-evdev wireless-tools wpa_supplicant linux-firmware-i915
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for the most part your system is ready to use. Your system will be fast; but MUSL will not permit you to use most packages normally.</p>

On HackTCNJ 2024
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202402231929.54# -->

<p>The past weekend was a whirlwind of coding, learning, and teamwork at HackTCNJ 2024. It was my first hackathon experience, and I'm still processing the rollercoaster of emotions and insights that came with it.</p>

<p>Firstly, I quickly understood how different in person hackathons were from the virtual competitions I had taken part in prior to this. After trying both USACO and PClassic it occured to me that I had no inherent interest in solving algorithmic problems; it feels too far removed from the actual importance of programming and innovation; rather feels like a math test. Even though these competitions are highly prestigious, hackathons are far more applicable to the business world and my interest in programming as there is significantly more room for innovation.</p>

<p>The hackathon felt very immersive and was very motivating. I am very enthusiastic about Major League Hacking in general and appreciated the environment they provided with free food, conducive workspace, and no costs to participants even though the event was held in person. </p>

<p>The chief benefit of hackathons is the networking, in my opinion. I met the <a href="https://ruslug.org">Rutgers Student Linux User Group</a> president at the hackathon and we discussed Linux, FOSS, and the like. I met groups who built various sorts of projects: a radar, an AI webcam-based mouse, a 2d game with physics, a truth table generator... A huge variety of people from different backgrounds making a variety of different projects. </p>

<p>Prior to the event, my team and I decided to tackle a seemingly insurmountable challenge: building an operating system from scratch. In hindsight, it was an overly ambitious project for a hackathon, but we managed to make some progress, including creating a VGA driver, porting parts of libc, and delving into memory management.</p>

<p>Throughout this project, I was reminded once again of the importance of perseverance and embracing the slow, incremental improvements that come with tackling complex problems which was a theme that resonated from my 3d renderer project, as well. It's easy to feel discouraged when progress seems slow, but each small step forward is a testament to our growing understanding and skill.</p>

<p>As we worked on our OS, I couldn't help but notice that the winning teams had taken a different approach. They focused on solving specific, real-world problems rather than attempting to build something as complex as an operating system. For instance, the winning high school team created an innovative solution called "Expand-A-Conda," which used the pre-existing NVIDIA MIT-B5 model to detect earthquake survivors and deploy a simple, expanding plastic bag to help locate them.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the Expand-A-Conda team didn't develop their own AI model; instead, they leveraged an existing one and combined it with a relatively straightforward hardware component. This illustrates the power of focusing on practical problem-solving rather than striving for technical complexity for its own sake.</p>

<p>This experience taught me the value of focusing on problem-solving and applying existing skills to create practical solutions. While our OS project was impressive in its technical complexity, it lacked the immediate impact and relevance that the winning projects demonstrated.</p>

<p>Looking back, I realize that this lesson is applicable not only to hackathons but also to the broader world of entrepreneurship and innovation. Teams that identify and address pressing problems are more likely to gain traction and succeed than those that focus solely on pushing the boundaries of technology for its own sake.</p>

<p>As I prepare for my next hackathon, CJCP Hacks, I'm eager to apply these insights and work on a project that balances technical complexity with real-world relevance. My team and I have already started planning our strategy, and I'm excited to see what we can create in just 12 hours. </p>

<p>In the meantime, I'll be working on improving my website and addressing some technical issues, such as the date formatting problem I've encountered with BashBlog on Alpine Linux. Despite these challenges, I remain optimistic and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>

Petition Signing Finally Setup!
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202401222216.53# -->
<div class="subtitle">January 22, 2024 &mdash;

<p>Before, you had to send me an email, or be lucky enough to be at my in person signing events to sign my petition... but no longer! You can now sign the petition on the homepage or <a href="/petition.html">here</a>. It only took me 2 days to reprogram the site, it being static initially...</p>

<h4>How did you do it?</h4>

<p>The petition signing uses a raw HTML form. I wanted the frontend to be as minimalist as possible and for most of the work to be handled by the backend, which did pose some pretty big difficulties.</p>

<p>The config for the server currently looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>server "omraheja.us.to" {
    listen on * port 80
    root "/htdocs/omraheja.us.to"

    location "/pub/*" {
        directory auto index
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>OpenBSD httpd is pretty straightforward, so all I did was change it to this: </p>

<pre><code>server "omraheja.us.to" {
    listen on * port 80
    root "/htdocs/omraheja.us.to"

        location "/pub/*" {
            directory auto index
        }

        location "/vote.cgi" {
            fastcgi socket "/run/slowcgi.sock"
            root "/cgi-bin"
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and then in /cgi-bin I wrote about 200 lines of vulnerable C. It's really been a while, I had almost forgotten how to use stdio's file API.</p>

<h4>Hardest parts</h4>

<p>This project is not complicated at all, it was just frustrating; it managed to prove how rough my C programming had became.</p>

<p>You may ask why I chose C for such a project. Typically for CGI scripts, perl is used for its simplicity and support. The thing is, perl is an interpretive language, and this tiny vm I'm using has very limited resources. Having to run an actual executable instead of reading files is already a lot slower, so why not just put it in a native, compiled, language?</p>

<p>Besides, I've been using C as my main language for 2 years. On the rare occasion that I decide to code, C is almost always my language of choice.</p>

<p>That being said, the hardest part was supporting application/x-www-url-formencoded. Parsing it myself actually wasn't that difficult once I realized that anything thats not alphanumerical or a period will be encoded as a hex with a % sign before. </p>

<p>strtol(3) is pretty garbage for this job, so I decided to parse it myself. For something like <code>%2a</code> in </p>

<pre><code>name=om%2a
</code></pre>

<p>The respective C code was as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>real = (hex_to_char(first) &lt;&lt; 4) | hex_to_char(second);
</code></pre>

<p>In simple words, it converts the '2' to a 2 and stores it in the upper 4 bits and 'a' to 10 and stores it in the lower 4 bits. It's pretty efficient.</p>

<p>Once I relearned the file API and figured out how to make it append to a csv file, I had to mess around with permissions for the chroot directory until I realized a simple <code>chmod a+w signatures.csv</code> would do the job.</p>

<p>The biggest problem right now is ratelimiting, because I don't want bot based spam. I don't want to IP rate limit, because then I will have a lot of trouble at public signing events.</p>

<p>The final solution to this would be to implement something like <a href="https://simplecaptcha.sourceforge.net/">SimpleCaptcha</a>. It could be implemented easily server side and would require little to no JavaScript. It's not so annoying that it would prevent public signing events, but would allow only the more advanced bots to spam my form.</p>

<h4>Source code?</h4>

<p>I love making my projects open source, and this is no exception. I'm going to get a git hosted locally soon for my organization. </p>

Snow Day

<p>Today is a beautiful snow day with a day off from school, yet I am at home, inside, studying. We had a snow day on Tuesday, which I also didn't go out on. </p>

<h4>What's going on?</h4>

<p>I'm working on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>my AP exams</p></li>
<li><p>my GPA (yes, my grades are really bad, even though they've improved a lot from freshman year)</p></li>
<li><p>my petiton: I'm working on getting approval from my school and other schools in my district's administration to spread my petition on school grounds. It's not bound to be very effective, but since I spend most of my time here, I may as well start here. Since I live near bustling universities, I probably will contact them too.</p></li>
<li><p>my business: I definitely need a website for my business with good SEO so that people can look me up and feel confident. I've got it all outlined out and me and my team are working on the CSS for the site (which will definitely look way better than my main site) but it seems like it is better to hire a freelancer on fiverr; they charge low rates and they make decent websites. I've found several people with React and CSS experience for as low as $5. However, my team has agreed to give the CSS an attempt first, and then consider hiring an actual developer. I agree with this decision, but the idea of hiring a freelancer will remain in all of our heads.</p></li>
<li><p>swimming: We have the county championships coming up at our school in about a week. I will be swimming my favorite, 400 free, but I need to tighten up my game before I go out there and race.</p></li>
<li><p>FBLA: I have yet to finish selling candy bars to fund our State Leadership Conference. In addition to that, I have to prepare for my Computer Problem Solving objective test, and the Business Ethics team presentation.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>Should I take a break?</h4>

<p>I love to get my work done, and I have a lot of work on my hands. I recall the last time we had snow in 2022, there was nothing stopping me from getting out there. But that was also 2 years ago, and things have really changed since then. The January of 2021, being the one during COVID and middle school is particularly memorable to me, because I just allowed myself to roll all over, throw snowballs, build a fort and whatever with my sibling. </p>

<p>As with most things in life, it's a tradeoff. I don't know if I still enjoy running everywhere in the snow, and I don't think we are getting more snow days this year. Therefore, it may be worth the experience?</p>

<p>It is currently late at night, and instead of sleeping, I am up writing this blog post. I'm likely to wake up the next morning in utter confusion of what I have wrote here tonight.</p>

<h4>BashBlog (continued)</h4>

<p>I tried to configure bashblog to work better, by perhaps intregrating the blog and the frontpage together, but such a project is not for me. I don't want to poke around with the internals of this 1,000 line script any more than I've done already. If I feel like pursuing this later, you'll see the site look a lot more unified and improved.</p>

<p>There also seems to be this weird glitch with an unnamed post in my blog, which caused the timestamp "January 08, 2024" to randomly appear at the top. I don't know how to fix it yet, but I will because I don't like it. That being said, once the front page hits its post limit, it may also disappear.</p>

<p>That being said, I probably will unify the CSS in some way later, and will definitely work on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) first. </p>

<h4>FBLA Summit</h4>

<p>I went to a <a href="https://fbla.org">Future Business Leaders of America</a> regional summit on Friday, and I learned quite a bit. Let me sum it up for you: 
- I improved my confidence a lot more, because of the networking and law session that I chose. I can't say I liked one more than the other, as I met people from vastly different environments who had a keen interest in the business world and who also would like to make new friends. The law one was my favorite, because it enforced some of the concepts I was taught in my <a href="https://jsa.org">JSA</a> experience, and how statistics along with theoretical makes your argument more convincing.
- I gained a lot of useful knowledge and contacts. More than business related knowledge, I think I gained a new outlook on life. I came up with a better process to present myself in the professional world involving a set of rigid core values, which I followed already but going to summit helped me enforce those values. I met people who could help me accomplish my hopes and dreams and saved their contact information.
- I had fun. It's not everyday I get to take time off from school, much less I get to meet new people. I don't dislike school, but a break is appreciated from time to time. Alongside of being a professional summit, it was generally a place for me to be social and for me and my friends to enjoy ourselves.</p>

<h4>Personality Change</h4>

<p>Think it's kind of strange, but I'm picking up on developments in my own personality over time. I don't know how common this is or anyone else who notices changes like these, but I thought I would write about it anyways, since it seems interesting.</p>

<p>A quick google search of personality change doesn't yield much, except for the bipolar disorder, and the like. I am highly doubtful that there is any correlation between my experience and mental disorders, but instead a response to my environment.</p>

<p>As time goes on, it seems as if I idolize things or people much less. I recall at the start of this school year, I was very disappointed to find out that I would not be able to spend as much time with a friend from a neighboring district. At the time, she meant the entire world to me, and I'm glad that I was able to express that even though it took me a few days to get all my thoughts and emotions out.</p>

<p>Eventually, it came to a time where we would not be able to meet each other for almost a month at a time, which at the beginning was pretty degrading on my emotional health, but as time passed, those emotions started to disappear. In fact, the first time around, it seemed as if the inverse had occured, that I hadn't met her in so long, that I didn't want to meet her at all. I didn't want those powerful emotions to be invoked again.</p>

<p>And when I met her after that, it was as if I was a different person. I became completely distant and she wasn't sure what to do with me, which is funny in retrospect. The pattern continued, and by the end of this arbitrary cycle my interactions with her became completely distorted, but in a more positive manner.</p>

<p>These interactions, in fact, are what helped me to realize this change. A few months ago, maybe in the start of September, I was more reserved, very honest and didn't really say much other than deep talk. Now, I wouldn't say I'm the complete opposite, but I'm much more outgoing and a burst of energy. It's easier for me to form interactions this way, now that my confidence has improved, which came from a lot of public speaking in JSA. My interaction type in September wasn't bad, it was just less like myself. I'm a lot more goofy than most people are.</p>

<p>That brings me to another point. It was commonly accepted in my area that being goofy was a simple way to protect yourself from real emotions. In retrospect, that is partially true if you are concealing your real emotions, but my heart desires me to do stupid things and make stupid jokes, so that itself is part of my personality. Whether it protects myself from "real emotions", or is negative in general and lowers my reputation or whatever, it doesn't matter in the end because this new interaction type has made me a lot happier and has definitely improved my confidence.</p>

<p>As another example, I had this other close friend who I wasn't able to understand, and was under the severe misconception that she disliked me because she wanted to get work done during free study. Now, I spent the majority of my school day with her, knowing her only for 2 months but we had already gotten so close together, irrespective of our differences. The next day, I went to school without talking to her, and felt like garbage. I decided to tell another friend how I was feeling, even though we weren't that close. It eased the pain a little. The next day came, and it hurt a lot, but this time a little less. I quickly moved to make new friends because I realized that if I continued to get hurt through my lack of interaction with her I wouldn't last very long.</p>

<p>A few days later, I wasn't able to take it anymore, because she was sitting right in front of me and doing her work during free study. On a completely divided basis, I decided to go sit next to her and finish my work, not knowing what else to do. And so I made up a stupid excuse to sit next to her, and she saw right through it... but I sat there anyways and didn't say anything and just finished my work.</p>

<p>She looked at me a couple of times, confused, and scrolled through some reels on her phone. I glanced at her from time to time but I was bent on finishing my work, and that's what I did for the most part. Eventually she saw a funny reel and showed me and we both started laughing, and it reduced the intensity of the mood a lot. By the end of it, I asked her if she was mad at me, and after hearing her response I felt significantly relieved.</p>

<p>I did not sit with her with the intention that the conflict would be resolved. It was a risky decision and could have hurt me potentially, but I was confident that I could take the risk, knowing very little about her emotions, I did.</p>

<p>To simplify, it seems as if my personality development has stemed from a confidence change. I can project much better, make jokes in front of a whole group of people, laugh at my own mistakes, and feel good too. At the beginning, I mentioned that I stopped idolizing people and things. For people, it came to me that I can form deep connections with any kind of people, I just have to stay confident throughout the process. </p>

<p>I'm also experiencing personality change in other parts, of my life, not just my connections. I stopped worrying about my grades and whether my GPA would permit me to go into any college, and started focusing more on enjoying the work I did at school. It wasn't necessarily easy nor is it anything I want to do, but I took an interest in it and the process of learning and my grades have reached much higher than they have before. </p>

<p>In swimming, I'm not always sure about whether I can beat the competition or my own personal records at all, but I've been working harder in practice since November, to increase my confidence as a swimmer. This can also be extended to other parts of my life, as my willingness to purchase stocks with my own hard-earned money (after <strong>thorough</strong> research), asking for letters of recommendation for various summer programs, and so forth. My personality change seems to be constructed out of a push for confidence, which definitely has created a lot of upsides and has also made me unrecognizable to my friend listed above, as well as my other friends, family, past teachers, and colleagues. I would infer then, that a confidence boost has a significant amount of indirect upsides through the modifications of my own physcology. However, I still have a lot of improvements to make, so I will continue to work on my confidence.</p>
