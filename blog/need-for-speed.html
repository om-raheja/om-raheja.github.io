<p>Every startup needs to go <strong>fast</strong>. How am I going to do that?</p>

<hr />

<p>In the beginning of my professional career, every project I undertook would remain unfinished because I realized the difficulty of attaining perfection in that field. In fact, it was impossible. I remember designing a website and adding URL-http redirects when the initial product wasn't even finished. And I never finished that project, nor any others like it. After years, I finally realize where my obsession with perfection came from, and how I can help others like myself overcome it.</p>

<p>I've started focusing on the immediate problems. There's no sense of collective direction, or at least there are too many ways in which we are expanding which leads to procrastination. I think we need one defined, unified plan and bring people on board with it. </p>

<p>In addition to that, I want to focus on cutting down procrastination, which is a prevalent problem for both me and my team. If I can simplify the aquarc playing field and help people manage their commitments effectively, I can help myself and others overcome procrastination.</p>

<p>Building aquarc isn't coding up a useful platform for high school students. It's a battle against all the problems high schoolers face, inside and outside the team. Time management being something that everyone sucks at, maybe that's a strong potential direction for aquarc once we mature at it. </p>
