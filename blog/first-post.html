<h1>My First Post</h1>

<p>I thought I would setup <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">BashBlog</a> because it provides a nice alternative to social media. Not that I use any of that, I have no accounts on any major platforms. I might include a list of all the pages I've deleted my accounts from later.</p>

<p>I'm not going to waste your time here. I'll divide it up into sections of what I've done and why.</p>

<h2>BashBlog</h2>

<p>I attempted to make my own blogger in bash. After a few minutes, I realized its a lot more effort than it's worth, so I began looking for "blog generators". I found <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/create-static-blog-linux-terminal-with-bashblog/">this article</a> after a little searching, downloaded it and started writing this post in markdown.</p>

<p>Once I got onto the GitHub page, it didn't take me more than a few seconds to recognize the author, cfenollosa! He was the one who made the famous <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial">os-tutorial</a> to make your own operating system from scratch a while ago. For those of you who understand the value of his tutorial, there need be no explanation as to why this was included in my blog post.</p>

<h2>Ice Skating!</h2>

<p>This weekend I tried ice skating. Can't say it was easy, I hurt my knee and fell at least 20 times... I learned a lot, though. I was very eager to leave the railing and try to skate on my own, which is the likely cause of me falling so much, but if I didn't let go I don't think I would have learned otherwise.</p>

<p>Firstly, I have injuries all over my legs, mostly from the skates. I readjusted my skate multiple times in the short timespan I was at the rink, and even after readjustment I was unable to bend my knees to accelerate properly. It's likely this is more my fault than the skates, so I'll experiment a little before I decide rental skates are bad in general. It might just be worth it to spend $200 and get a nice pair if anyone is actually serious about it, which I am not.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I dislike individual sports. There's no reason why, but it just seems to get boring after some time. I suppose I am a swimmer, but there is definitely a significant amount of teamwork involved in swimming, as we are organized as a team and we make sacrifices to help others achieve their dreams and we cheer each other on during their swims. I don't believe I can make any judgement of ice skating yet, but from my experience, casual ice skating is really fun to do with your friends, maybe not a team sport but especially in the early stages a lot of teamwork. That being said, I may further my interest in it.</p>

<h2>SEC parser</h2>

<p>I started working on a parser that obtains data right from the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation">EDGAR API</a> because I'm done with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com">Yahoo Finance</a> and other ripoffs. I want a high quality, valuation based investment software without the fancy graphs and EPS before <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/103101.asp">pro forma earnings</a>. Not only that, the forward ratios and the TTM's throw me off all the time. It also requires a premium subscription to pay for financials past 1 year. Of course, it makes them money so its justified, but that software is not meant for me.</p>

<p>You could say I could resort to Nasdaq or some other official source. I intend to parse those sources for their dividend history and other information not available easily on EDGAR, but I want as accurate data as possible, even if that means I sacrifice a little precision with the number of outstanding shares and whatnot.</p>

<p>There are no ETAs or pull requests or anything, as with my other projects. I will get my git hosted soon and then it will be up, but I'm working on this solely out of my leisure, with my friend. </p>
