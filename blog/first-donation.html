<p>Today I started recurring donations, deducting a part of my paycheck. The feeling of donating is one of the best things I've felt in a long time.</p>

<hr />

<p>Even though I come from an affluent family, I am always short on cash. I refuse to let my parents pay for my desires and ambitions, which is really difficult: but I'll do what I can. During school and swim season, I work as a lifeguard, often during odd hours, sometimes taking a break during my shift to swim my event. </p>

<p><a href="https://codeabode.co">codeabode</a> has also been expanding; although the team shrunk like intended, I've shifted my focus onto my two paying customers and gave the team some autonomy over the rest. It took almost 2 months for results to show by shifting team dynamics at <a href="https://aquarc.org">aquarc</a>, but if I don't start now, when will I?</p>

<p>Currently I'm donating to <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> and the <a href="https://trentonsoupkitchen.org/">Trenton Soup Kitchen</a>, two of my favorite nonprofits. I use Signal for day to day communication between my friends and both organizations, which isn't necessary but at least demonstrates my respect for the platform. </p>

<p>As for the Trenton Soup Kitchen, I've always wanted to volunteer there and help out. I started reading <em>Evicted: Poverty and Profit in America</em> by Matthew Desmond recently, and I want to deepen my understanding of poverty and mitigate it. In fact, I didn't think poverty in America was a real problem until a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>It will be very hard for me to keep up with my payments, but I want to give back to the organizations that shaped who I am today. Signal is a symbol of the FOSS-lover inside me who wants to retreat to a farm in Idaho and keep my data all to myself. Now that I understand this vision isn't possible in the long term, I still stick to Signal because that is, and it prevents people from having unnecessary data on me. And as for the Trenton Soup Kitchen, I don't think anyone deserves to feel hungry for an extended period of time. </p>

<p>Although my donations amount to a meager $10/month, it definitely is a start. I want to give more to the community in the long run: not only in the form of money, but time and effort as well. That, I believe, is the real test of devotion.</p>
