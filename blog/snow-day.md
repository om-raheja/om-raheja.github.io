Snow Day

Today is a beautiful snow day with a day off from school, yet I am at home, inside, studying. We had a snow day on Tuesday, which I also didn't go out on. 

#### What's going on?
I'm working on:

1. my AP exams

2.  my GPA (yes, my grades are really bad, even though they've improved a lot from freshman year)

3.  my petiton: I'm working on getting approval from my school and other schools in my district's administration to spread my petition on school grounds. It's not bound to be very effective, but since I spend most of my time here, I may as well start here. Since I live near bustling universities, I probably will contact them too.

4.  my business: I definitely need a website for my business with good SEO so that people can look me up and feel confident. I've got it all outlined out and me and my team are working on the CSS for the site (which will definitely look way better than my main site) but it seems like it is better to hire a freelancer on fiverr; they charge low rates and they make decent websites. I've found several people with React and CSS experience for as low as $5. However, my team has agreed to give the CSS an attempt first, and then consider hiring an actual developer. I agree with this decision, but the idea of hiring a freelancer will remain in all of our heads.

5.  swimming: We have the county championships coming up at our school in about a week. I will be swimming my favorite, 400 free, but I need to tighten up my game before I go out there and race.

6. FBLA: I have yet to finish selling candy bars to fund our State Leadership Conference. In addition to that, I have to prepare for my Computer Problem Solving objective test, and the Business Ethics team presentation.

#### Should I take a break?
I love to get my work done, and I have a lot of work on my hands. I recall the last time we had snow in 2022, there was nothing stopping me from getting out there. But that was also 2 years ago, and things have really changed since then. The January of 2021, being the one during COVID and middle school is particularly memorable to me, because I just allowed myself to roll all over, throw snowballs, build a fort and whatever with my sibling. 

As with most things in life, it's a tradeoff. I don't know if I still enjoy running everywhere in the snow, and I don't think we are getting more snow days this year. Therefore, it may be worth the experience?
